## Overview
BVI-CR is an open multi-view volumetric human dataset designed to advance 3D data compression research. It comprises 18 multi-view RGB-D captures with corresponding textured polygonal meshes, featuring diverse human actions. Each sequence includes 10 views at 1080p, 30FPS, and 10-15 seconds duration. Using BVI-CR, we benchmarked traditional and neural multi-view video compression methods under MPEG MIV Common Test Conditions, demonstrating up to 38% coding gain in PSNR for neural approaches. This dataset serves as a platform for volumetric reconstruction, compression, and quality assessment.
